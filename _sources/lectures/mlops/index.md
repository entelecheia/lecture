# Machine Learning Systems Design

## Course Description

This course provides an in-depth exploration of designing and implementing machine learning systems, with a focus on the practical considerations of deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production. Students will learn how to design, build, and deploy machine learning models, and how to integrate machine learning into an organization's broader software development process. The course will cover best practices in DevOps and MLOps, including dot files, git, docker, kubernetes, CI/CD, model selection, development, training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and continual learning. The course will also cover training data management, experiment tracking, and model versioning with tools such as Weights & Biases.
