# DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is intended to bring together developers and operations teams to improve communication and collaboration, allowing them to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.
