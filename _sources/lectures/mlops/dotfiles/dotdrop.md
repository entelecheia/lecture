# Dotdrop

**A Powerful Tool for Managing Dotfiles**

## Introduction

Dotdrop is a versatile and efficient tool designed to help you manage your dotfiles across multiple systems, making it easier than ever to synchronize and deploy configuration files. Dotfiles, named for their leading dot (e.g., .bashrc, .vimrc), are hidden configuration files used by various applications and tools in UNIX-based systems. They store your personalized settings, making it convenient to set up your preferred environment on multiple machines.

With Dotdrop, you can maintain a single, centralized repository for all your dotfiles and effortlessly deploy them to different systems using profiles. This approach saves time and ensures consistency across various environments.

Key features of Dotdrop include:

1. Simple configuration: Dotdrop uses a single YAML configuration file to manage your dotfiles and their deployment.
2. Templating support: Dotdrop utilizes the powerful Jinja2 templating engine, allowing you to create dynamic and adaptable configuration files that cater to the specific requirements of different systems.
3. Profiles: Dotdrop's profiles help you define custom settings for each system, ensuring a personalized and consistent setup across multiple machines.
4. Synchronization: Dotdrop enables you to keep your dotfiles synchronized across various systems using Git or any other version control system, making it easy to track changes and updates.

## Usage

To start using Dotdrop for managing your dotfiles, follow these basic steps:

1. **Installation:**
   Install Dotdrop using pip:

   ```
   pip install dotdrop --user
   ```

2. **Initialization:**
   Create a new dotfiles repository and initialize Dotdrop:

   ```
   mkdir ~/dotfiles
   cd ~/dotfiles
   dotdrop init
   ```

   This will generate a `config.yaml` file in the `~/dotfiles` directory.

3. **Add dotfiles:**
   Import your existing dotfiles to the repository:

   ```
   dotdrop import ~/.bashrc
   dotdrop import ~/.vimrc
   ```

   This will copy your dotfiles to the repository and update the `config.yaml` file with the necessary information.

4. **Create a profile:**
   Edit the `config.yaml` file to define a profile for your current system:

   ```yaml
   config:
     backup: true
     create: true
     dotpath: dotfiles
   profiles:
     my-system:
       - bashrc
       - vimrc
   dotfiles:
     bashrc:
       src: bashrc
       dst: ~/.bashrc
     vimrc:
       src: vimrc
       dst: ~/.vimrc
   ```

   Replace `my-system` with a unique name for your current system.

5. **Deploy dotfiles:**
   Apply your dotfiles to the current system using the specified profile:

   ```
   dotdrop install --profile=my-system
   ```

   This will create or update the dotfiles in your home directory with the files stored in the repository.

6. **Synchronize changes:**
   If you make changes to your dotfiles, you can easily synchronize them back to the repository:

   ```
   dotdrop update ~/.bashrc
   dotdrop update ~/.vimrc
   ```

   Remember to commit and push the changes to your remote repository (e.g., GitHub) to keep your dotfiles in sync across multiple systems.

These basic steps should help you get started with Dotdrop for managing and deploying your dotfiles across different systems. For advanced usage, such as templating and custom actions, refer to the official Dotdrop documentation.
