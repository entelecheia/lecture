# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files that are used to customize your shell and other applications. Dotfiles are a great way to standardize your development environment. You can use the same dotfiles in your local development environment, in your CI/CD pipeline, and in your production environment.

## Dotfiles in a GitOps workflow

Dotfiles management is not a core component of GitOps; however, it can complement the GitOps approach by applying similar principles of version control, collaboration, and automation to managing personal configurations and settings.

In a GitOps workflow, Git is used as the single source of truth for managing infrastructure and application configurations. Dotfiles, on the other hand, are configuration files for various tools, applications, and environments, typically used to personalize a user's system.

Although dotfiles management is not directly related to the GitOps process, it can benefit from some of the best practices that GitOps promotes:

- Version Control: By storing dotfiles in a Git repository, you can track changes, create backups, and easily restore previous versions if needed. This is similar to how GitOps uses Git as the single source of truth for managing infrastructure and application configurations.

- Collaboration: Storing dotfiles in a Git repository enables sharing and collaboration with others, which allows you to learn from others' configurations and apply best practices. In a similar vein, GitOps leverages Git's collaboration features for managing infrastructure and applications.

- Automation: You can use scripts or tools to automate the setup and management of your dotfiles, making it easier to replicate your environment across multiple systems or when setting up a new machine. GitOps also emphasizes automation in synchronizing the desired state with the actual state of your infrastructure and applications.

- Organization and Modularity: Organizing your dotfiles in a structured and modular way makes it easier to manage, maintain, and understand your configurations. This mirrors the GitOps approach, which emphasizes the use of declarative and modular configurations for infrastructure and applications.

While dotfiles management is focused on personalizing user environments and tool configurations, the principles of version control, collaboration, automation, and organization can be applied in a similar manner as GitOps. This allows users to manage their dotfiles more efficiently and consistently across multiple systems.

## Tools for managing dotfiles

#### Initialize chezmoi

If it is the first time you use chezmoi, you need to initialize it.

```sh
chezmoi init
```

Or if you want to use the existing repository as your dotfiles repository, you can use the following command.

```sh
$ chezmoi init https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
```

Check what changes that chezmoi will make to your home directory by running:

```sh
chezmoi diff
```

Apply the changes by running:

```sh
chezmoi apply -v
```

#### Install packages with scripts

Change to the source directory and create a file called `run_once_install-packages.sh`:

```sh
chezmoi cd
touch run_once_install-packages.sh
```
