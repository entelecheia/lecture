# Simple MLOps Pipeline

In this lecture, we will introduce the concept of a simple MLOps pipeline, which aims to provide a straightforward and efficient approach to managing the ML lifecycle, tailored to small teams and projects with limited resources. We will explore the various stages of a typical pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Furthermore, we will discuss how to integrate popular open-source tools, such as containerd and MicroK8s, to facilitate the implementation of the pipeline on a local server.

By the end of this lecture, you will have a solid understanding of the key components and principles of a simple MLOps pipeline. You will also be equipped with the knowledge to design, implement, and maintain an MLOps pipeline tailored to the needs of your team and project, ultimately enabling you to deliver high-quality ML models more efficiently.

## Prerequisites: Before Diving into Simple MLOps Pipeline

To make the most of this lecture and ensure a smooth learning experience, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the foundational knowledge and skills required to understand and implement a simple MLOps pipeline. The following prerequisites will provide you with a solid foundation for this lecture:

1. `Basic understanding of Machine Learning`: Familiarize yourself with essential ML concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, training and validation data, model evaluation metrics, and common algorithms like regression, classification, and clustering.
2. `Knowledge of Python programming`: Since many MLOps pipelines and ML frameworks utilize Python, it is crucial to have a good grasp of Python programming, including basic data structures, control structures, and functions.
3. `Familiarity with version control using Git and GitHub`: Version control is a crucial aspect of MLOps. Learn the basics of using Git and GitHub to manage code repositories, commit changes, and collaborate with team members.
4. `Experience with command-line interfaces (CLI)`: As MLOps pipelines often involve working with command-line tools and server environments, be comfortable with executing commands in a terminal or command prompt, navigating directories, and managing files.
5. `Introduction to containerization technologies`: Understand the fundamentals of containerization, specifically using container runtimes like containerd, and learn how to create, manage, and deploy containers.
6. `Basics of Kubernetes and MicroK8s`: Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform, and its lightweight distribution, MicroK8s. Learn how to create and manage Kubernetes resources like ConfigMaps, Secrets, Deployments, and Services.
7. `Understanding of SSH and server management`: Learn the basics of SSH, including generating key pairs, setting up public key authentication, and managing user accounts on a server.
8. `Introductory knowledge of DevOps principles`: Get acquainted with the core principles of DevOps, such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code, which will help you understand and appreciate the MLOps pipeline's underlying concepts.

While not all of these prerequisites are mandatory, a solid grasp of the topics mentioned above will enable you to better understand the intricacies of a simple MLOps pipeline and facilitate a more efficient learning experience.
