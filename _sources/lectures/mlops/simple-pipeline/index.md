By the end of this lecture, you will have a solid understanding of the key components and principles of a simple MLOps pipeline. You will also be equipped with the knowledge to design, implement, and maintain an MLOps pipeline tailored to the needs of your team and project, ultimately enabling you to deliver high-quality ML models more efficiently.

## Prerequisites: Before Diving into Simple MLOps Pipeline

To make the most of this lecture and ensure a smooth learning experience, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the foundational knowledge and skills required to understand and implement a simple MLOps pipeline. The following prerequisites will provide you with a solid foundation for this lecture:

1. `Basic understanding of Machine Learning`: Familiarize yourself with essential ML concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, training and validation data, model evaluation metrics, and common algorithms like regression, classification, and clustering.
2. `Knowledge of Python programming`: Since many MLOps pipelines and ML frameworks utilize Python, it is crucial to have a good grasp of Python programming, including basic data structures, control structures, and functions.
3. `Familiarity with version control using Git and GitHub`: Version control is a crucial aspect of MLOps. Learn the basics of using Git and GitHub to manage code repositories, commit changes, and collaborate with team members.
4. `Experience with command-line interfaces (CLI)`: As MLOps pipelines often involve working with command-line tools and server environments, be comfortable with executing commands in a terminal or command prompt, navigating directories, and managing files.
5. `Introduction to containerization technologies`: Understand the fundamentals of containerization, specifically using container runtimes like containerd, and learn how to create, manage, and deploy containers.
6. `Basics of Kubernetes and MicroK8s`: Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform, and its lightweight distribution, MicroK8s. Learn how to create and manage Kubernetes resources like ConfigMaps, Secrets, Deployments, and Services.
7. `Understanding of SSH and server management`: Learn the basics of SSH, including generating key pairs, setting up public key authentication, and managing user accounts on a server.
8. `Introductory knowledge of DevOps principles`: Get acquainted with the core principles of DevOps, such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code, which will help you understand and appreciate the MLOps pipeline's underlying concepts.

While not all of these prerequisites are mandatory, a solid grasp of the topics mentioned above will enable you to better understand the intricacies of a simple MLOps pipeline and facilitate a more efficient learning experience.

## Implementing a Simple MLOps Pipeline

### 1. Install containerd

First, let's install containerd, a lightweight container runtime, on your server. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Update the system packages
sudo apt-get update

# Install containerd
sudo apt-get install -y containerd
```

### 2. Configure containerd

Create a default configuration file for containerd:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/containerd
sudo containerd config default | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml
```

Then, enable and start the containerd service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd
```

### 3. Install MicroK8s

MicroK8s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution. Install it using the following commands:

```bash
# Add the MicroK8s repository
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list'
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Update the system packages
sudo apt-get update

# Install MicroK8s
sudo apt-get install -y microk8s
```

### 4. Configure MicroK8s

Enable the necessary MicroK8s add-ons:

```bash
microk8s enable dns storage ingress
```

Allow your user to access MicroK8s commands without sudo:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER
sudo chown -f -R $USER ~/.kube
```

Log out and log back in for these changes to take effect.

### 5. Set up SSH access for the team

For each team member, create a user account and set up SSH access. Replace `USERNAME` with the appropriate username.

```bash
# Create a user account
sudo adduser USERNAME

# Add the user to the sudo group
sudo usermod -aG sudo USERNAME

# Set up SSH access
sudo mkdir /home/USERNAME/.ssh
sudo nano /home/USERNAME/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Paste the team member's public SSH key into the `authorized_keys` file. Save the file and set the proper permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R USERNAME:USERNAME /home/USERNAME/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /home/USERNAME/.ssh
sudo chmod 600 /home/USERNAME/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### 6. Set up the GitHub repository

Create a new GitHub repository for your project. Then, clone the repository on the local server and set up the necessary directories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
mkdir -p configs scripts
```

### 7. Create a simple MLOps pipeline

Create the necessary configuration files, scripts, and YAML files for your pipeline. Save these files in the `configs` and `scripts` directories of your GitHub repository.

For example, you can create a simple pipeline with the following components:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Model deployment

You can create separate scripts for each component and use Kubernetes resources like ConfigMaps, Secrets, Deployments, and Services to manage them. For instance, create a `preprocess.py` script for data preprocessing, a `train.py` script for model training, a `evaluate.py` script for model evaluation, and a `deploy.py` script for model deployment.

### 8. Configure Kubernetes resources

Create the appropriate YAML files for your Kubernetes resources in the `configs` directory. For example:

- `preprocess-configmap.yaml`: A ConfigMap for the data preprocessing configuration.
- `train-configmap.yaml`: A ConfigMap for the model training configuration.
- `evaluate-configmap.yaml`: A ConfigMap for the model evaluation configuration.
- `deploy-configmap.yaml`: A ConfigMap for the model deployment configuration.

- `preprocess-deployment.yaml`: A Deployment for running the data preprocessing script.
- `train-deployment.yaml`: A Deployment for running the model training script.
- `evaluate-deployment.yaml`: A Deployment for running the model evaluation script.
- `deploy-deployment.yaml`: A Deployment for running the model deployment script.

- `preprocess-service.yaml`: A Service for exposing the data preprocessing component.
- `train-service.yaml`: A Service for exposing the model training component.
- `evaluate-service.yaml`: A Service for exposing the model evaluation component.
- `deploy-service.yaml`: A Service for exposing the model deployment component.

### 9. Apply the Kubernetes configurations

Apply the configurations to your MicroK8s cluster using the following command:

```bash
microk8s kubectl apply -f configs/
```

### 10. Monitor the pipeline

Use the following command to monitor the status of your pipeline components:

```bash
microk8s kubectl get all
```

### 11. Update the pipeline

Whenever you make changes to the pipeline, commit and push them to the GitHub repository. Then, update the pipeline components on the server by pulling the latest changes and re-applying the configurations:

```bash
git pull
microk8s kubectl apply -f configs/
```

## Conclusion

In this lecture, you learned how to set up a simple MLOps pipeline on a server for a small team using containerd, MicroK8s, and other open-source tools. You also learned how to manage the pipeline using Git and a GitHub repository.
