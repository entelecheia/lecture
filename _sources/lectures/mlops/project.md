## Title

**MLOps Team Project: End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline from Bare Metal**

## Objective

This project aims to teach students the process of building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline starting from a bare metal system. The project will cover setting up the operating system, configuring a machine learning framework, and training a machine learning model. The final product will be shared with the class via a GitHub repository.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Linux operating systems
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts and frameworks
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Experience with Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration (optional but recommended)

## Project Overview

### 1. Project planning and team organization

- Define project scope and objectives
- Divide the class into sub-teams: OS setup, ML framework setup, model development, and MLOps setup
- Set up a project management tool (e.g., Trello) to track progress and assign tasks

## 2, Operating system setup

- Choose a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)
- Install and configure the opera.ing system on a bare metal server
- Set up user accounts and permissions
- Install and configure essential tools (e.g., SSH, Git)

### 3. Machine learning framework setup

- Choose an ML framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Install and configure the ML framework on the server
- Set up dependencies and libraries
- Test the framework with a sample ML model

### 4. Model development

- Select a problem and dataset (e.g., image classification, sentiment analysis)
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train and evaluate the model
- Fine-tune the model using hyperparameter optimization

### 5. MLOps setup

- Containerize the ML model using Docker
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions
- Deploy the model on a Kubernetes cluster (optional)
- Monitor the model performance and log relevant metrics
- Implement automated testing and validation

### 6. Finalization and documentation

- Consolidate the work of each sub-team
- Create comprehensive documentation on the project, including setup guides, model development, and deployment
- Share the final project on GitHub, ensuring that all team members have contributed to the repository
- Prepare a project presentation for the class, highlighting the main steps, challenges, and outcomes

## Outcomes

- Students will gain hands-on experience in setting up an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.
- Students will learn how to collaborate and divide tasks among team members effectively.
- Students will understand the importance of version control and documentation in MLOps.
- The final GitHub repository will serve as a resource for the class and future students.
