Agile Software Development is a **methodology** that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project. Unlike traditional software development like the Waterfall model, Agile processes integrate planning with execution, allowing for flexible and rapid response to change, which is a fundamental aspect in the tech industry today.

The core principles of Agile are derived from the **Agile Manifesto**, a formal proclamation of four fundamental values and twelve supporting principles that guide Agile project management. These values emphasize **individuals and interactions** over processes and tools, **working software** over comprehensive documentation, **customer collaboration** over contract negotiation, and **responding to change** over following a plan.

The rationale behind Agile methods includes customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery, embracing change, delivering working software frequently, and encouraging face-to-face conversation. It's about **building projects around motivated individuals**, giving them the environment and support they need, and trusting them to get the job done.

- **Agile is an iterative and incremental approach** to software design.
- **The Agile Manifesto** is the foundational document for Agile development.
- Agile methods facilitate **flexibility and adaptability** in the development process.
- Emphasizes direct communication and **collaboration**, rapid prototyping, and short feedback loops.

By focusing on the **fluidity of development** and being open to changing requirements, even late in the development cycle, Agile methodology champions a **customer-centric approach** that significantly reduces the overall risk associated with software development.
