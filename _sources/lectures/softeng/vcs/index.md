# Version Control Systems

This lecture aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of version control systems, with a focus on Git and GitHub, to software engineering students. Starting from the importance of version control in software development, the lecture will delve into its applications for individual developers and teams. Students will learn how to publish code repositories on GitHub, collaborate through Git, and employ advanced features such as branching, rebasing, and merging. Debugging techniques using Git bisect, as well as the collaborative workflow enabled by forks and pull requests, will also be covered. This all-encompassing approach aims to equip students with the skills necessary for effective code management and team collaboration.
