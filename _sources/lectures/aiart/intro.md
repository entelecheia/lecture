## Image GPT

The Image GPT is a transformer decoder model pretrained on a large collection of images in a self-supervised fashion.

## Timeline of ML Art

![timeline](../figs/aiart/intro/aiart_1_timeline.jpg)

- The first machines that generated art had an appearance in the 18th century e.g. work of Pierre Jaquet-Droz, who made three machines.
- Augusta Lovelace — a mathematician and poet, who for the first time paid attention to the fact that algorithms have a possible use outside of mathematics.
- The year 1955 gave us Jean Tinguely’s drawing machine — a mechanism that, once spun up, makes drawings.
- 1973’s AARON algorithm — the work of Harold Cohen, the effects of which was the first computer-generated image.
- In 2014, Ian G. Goodfellow’s work gave rise to the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network).
