    "## üé≤ Whole Game of NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we apply the concept of \"teaching the whole game\" to natural language processing (NLP). We believe that just like in baseball, students should be able to start playing with a general sense of NLP and gradually learn more rules and details as they progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many NLP courses that focus only on the technical aspects of the field, we take a practical approach to NLP. We show how to use fundamental concepts and techniques of NLP, including text pre-processing, morphology, syntax, semantics, text classification, topic modeling, and word embeddings, to solve real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by introducing students to a complete, working, and very usable NLP system that uses simple and expressive tools. Then, we gradually introduce more advanced concepts, showing students how to apply them to real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several advantages. It makes NLP more accessible and understandable to students, and it allows them to immediately start using NLP to solve their own problems. Furthermore, it helps students learn the whole game of NLP, not just individual concepts or techniques. By covering both the theory and practice of NLP, students will be well-prepared for further study or practical applications in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Harvard Professor David Perkins's book, [Making Learning Whole](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Learning-Whole-Principles-Transform/dp/0470633719), popularized the idea of \"teaching the whole game.\"\n"
