    "# N-gram Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "N-gram language models are a simple yet powerful approach to language modeling. They predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous n-1 words, where n is the order of the model. The main types of n-grams are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unigram**: Considers only a single word, ignoring context (n=1).\n",
    "- **Bigram**: Considers a sequence of two words (n=2).\n",
    "- **Trigram**: Considers a sequence of three words (n=3).\n",
    "- **Higher-order n-grams**: Considers longer sequences of words (n>3).\n",
    "\n",
    "In n-gram models, the probability of a word depends only on the (n-1) previous words. This simplification is known as the Markov assumption. To estimate the probabilities, n-gram models rely on counting the occurrences of n-grams in a large corpus and normalizing the counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of n-gram models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relatively simple and easy to implement.\n",
    "- Efficient in terms of computation and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of n-gram models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unable to capture long-range dependencies between words.\n",
    "- Sensitive to data sparsity issues, as some n-grams may not appear in the training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their limitations, n-gram models serve as a foundational tool for understanding language modeling concepts and are still used in various NLP applications.\n"

    "## N-Grams and Probability Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "N-grams can be used to estimate the probability of a word given a history (P(w|h)). For instance, if the history h is \"I like to eat\", we might want to estimate the probability of the next word being \"pizza\" (P(pizza|I like to eat)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating Probabilities from Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate this probability by counting the occurrences of the history followed by the target word in a large corpus and dividing by the total count of the history:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even with a large corpus, it's often not sufficient to provide good estimates due to the creative nature of language and the possibility of unseen word sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bigram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this issue, we can use the bigram model, which approximates the probability of a word given its entire history by considering only the preceding word:\n",

    "### Stock Prices and Markov Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "The Markov assumption can be applied to model stock prices as well. In finance, the Markov assumption is often used to represent the idea that future stock prices depend only on the current price and a limited number of past prices, rather than the entire price history.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between stock prices and the Markov assumption can be understood as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memoryless Property**: The Markov assumption implies that the stock price at a certain time is only influenced by a fixed number of previous time steps. This means that the future price movement doesn't depend on the entire history but only on the recent past. This property is also known as the memoryless property of Markov models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simplifying Complex Systems**: Stock prices are affected by a vast number of factors, including market trends, company performance, global events, and investor sentiment. By applying the Markov assumption, we can simplify the modeling of stock prices by focusing only on the most recent price changes, which are assumed to capture relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prediction and Analysis**: Using the Markov assumption in financial models allows us to predict and analyze stock price movements. For example, we can create Markov models to estimate the probabilities of stock price changes, which can be useful for trading strategies, risk management, and portfolio optimization.\n",

    "It's important to note that the Markov assumption is a simplification and may not always accurately represent the complexities of the stock market. However, it serves as a useful tool in modeling and analyzing stock prices.\n"

    "To estimate the probabilities for bigrams or n-grams, we use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) by counting the occurrences in a corpus and normalizing the counts.\n",

    "MLE, or Maximum Likelihood Estimation, is a statistical method used for estimating the parameters of a probability distribution or a model. It works by finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of the observed data under the given model. In other words, MLE selects the parameters that make the observed data most probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a dataset of coin tosses (heads and tails), and we want to estimate the probability of getting heads, we can use MLE to find the parameter value that makes the observed sequence of coin tosses most likely. This is usually done by calculating the ratio of the number of heads to the total number of tosses.\n",

    "Evaluating language models can be done in two main ways: extrinsic evaluation and intrinsic evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Extrinsic evaluation_ is the process of embedding a language model in an application and measuring its performance improvement in that application. For instance, in speech recognition, we can compare two language models by running a speech recognizer with each model and determining which one produces more accurate transcriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, running large NLP systems end-to-end can be resource-intensive. As an alternative, we can use _intrinsic evaluation_ metrics to quickly evaluate potential improvements in a language model. Intrinsic evaluation measures the quality of a model independent of any application.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform an intrinsic evaluation, we need a test set and a training set. The training set is used to train the parameters of the n-gram model, while the test set measures the model's performance. The better model is the one that assigns a higher probability to the test set, meaning it more accurately predicts the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial not to include test sentences in the training set, as this would introduce bias and lead to inaccurate probability-based metrics. Sometimes, we might use a test set so frequently that we tune to its characteristics. In such cases, a fresh test set, called the _development test set_ or _devset_, should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To divide data into training, development, and test sets, a common practice is to allocate 80% for training, 10% for development, and 10% for testing. Test data can either be taken from a continuous sequence within the corpus or be selected as smaller \"stripes\" from random parts of the corpus combined into a test set.\n"

    "## Perplexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity is a measure used to evaluate the performance of a language model. It quantifies how well a model predicts the probability distribution of a test set. A lower perplexity value indicates that the model is more accurate in predicting the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity can be understood as the weighted average branching factor of a language model. In other words, it represents the average number of possible next words the model considers at each step while generating a sentence. Lower perplexity means the model has fewer choices to consider, resulting in better prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perplexity (PP) of a language model on a test set can be calculated using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "PP(W) = P(w_1, w_2, ..., w_N)^{-1/N}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, W is the sequence of words in the test set, and N is the total number of words in the test set. $P(w_1, w_2, ..., w_N)$ is the joint probability of the entire word sequence in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we usually work with log probabilities to avoid numerical underflow, we can rewrite the perplexity equation using log probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "PP(W) = P(w_1, w_2, ..., w_N)^{-1/N}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of n-gram models, we can compute the perplexity by replacing the joint probability with the product of conditional probabilities of each word given its (n-1) previous words:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "PP(W) = exp(-1/N * (log(P(w_1|w_0)) + log(P(w_2|w_1)) + ... + log(P(w_N|w_{N-1}))))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a bigram model and the following test sentence: \"I like pizza\". The perplexity of the model on this test sentence can be calculated using the bigram probabilities as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Compute the log probabilities: $\\log(P(\\text{I}|\\text{<s>}))$, $\\log(P(\\text{like}|\\text{I}))$, $\\log(P(\\text{pizza}|\\text{like}))$, and $\\log(P(\\text{</s>}|\\text{pizza}))$.\n",
    "2.  Add up the log probabilities.\n",
    "3.  Divide the sum by the number of words in the test sentence (including the start and end symbols): $-1/5 * \\text{sum of log probabilities}$.\n",
    "4.  Take the exponent of the result: $\\exp(-1/5 * \\text{sum of log probabilities})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perplexity value obtained will be a measure of how well the bigram model predicts the test sentence \"I like pizza\".\n"

    "Perplexity is closely related to entropy, a concept from information theory. Entropy is a measure of the average amount of information (in bits) needed to represent the outcome of a random process, such as the choice of a word in a sentence. Lower entropy indicates that the outcomes are more predictable, while higher entropy implies more uncertainty.\n",
