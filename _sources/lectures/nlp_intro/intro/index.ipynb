    "## Why is NLP hard?\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP, or natural language processing, is a challenging field due to several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ambiguity**: Language is inherently ambiguous, and words or phrases can have multiple meanings depending on the context in which they are used. For example, the word \"bank\" can refer to a financial institution, a river bank, or the act of tilting or turning something. This ambiguity makes it difficult for NLP systems to accurately interpret a text.\n",
    "- **Change**: Language is constantly evolving and changing, with new words and phrases being added to the lexicon all the time. NLP systems need to be able to adapt to these changes and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in language use.\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Language is a complex system with many different levels of structure, from the smallest units of sound (phonemes) to the largest units of meaning (discourse). In order to accurately understand and generate language, NLP systems need to be able to decode the individual sounds and words, as well as the grammar and syntax. Additionally, understanding the intended message of a text requires an understanding of the cultural and historical context in which it was produced.\n",

    "- **Part of speech**: The same word can function as different parts of speech, such as \"chair\" being both a noun and a verb.\n",
    "- **Syntactic structure**: The same words can be structured in different ways to convey different meanings, such as \"I saw the man with the telescope\" implying that the man had the telescope, while \"I saw the man with the telescope\" implies that the speaker had the telescope.\n",

    "\n",
    "- How can we model ambiguity and choose correct analysis in context?\n",

    "Dealing with ambiguity in NLP is a challenging task. One of the ways to approach this challenge is by modeling ambiguity and choosing the correct analysis in context. Non-probabilistic methods return all possible analyses, while probabilistic models return the best possible analysis, which is the most probable one according to the model. However, it's important to note that the \"best\" analysis is only useful if the probabilities used in the model are accurate. Inaccurate probabilities may lead to incorrect analyses and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure accurate probabilities, NLP systems require large amounts of high-quality data to be trained on. The quality and size of the data set can significantly impact the accuracy of the model's predictions. Additionally, the use of advanced techniques such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms can help improve the accuracy of probabilistic models. Another approach to dealing with ambiguity is by incorporating contextual information into the analysis. By taking into account the context in which a word or phrase is used, NLP systems can better determine the intended meaning and reduce ambiguity.\n",

This can involve identifying the inflectional endings, prefixes, and suffixes that modify the root form of a word, as well as determining its syntactic role in the sentence.\n",
    "- **Word sense disambiguation**: This stage is used to identify the correct meaning of ambiguous words in the input text. This can involve using contextual clues or external knowledge sources to disambiguate between multiple possible meanings of a word.\n",

For example, POS tagging identifies the parts of speech of words, while syntactic parsing identifies the grammatical structure of sentences.\n",

    "## NLP in the Korean Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the Korean language presents several unique challenges due to the language's characteristics. For example, the verb \"to eat\" in Korean is \"밥을 먹다\" (bapeul meokda). The inflectional ending \"-을\" (eul) indicates that the verb is being used in the object position, and the noun \"밥\" (bap) means \"rice\" or \"meal.\" This example illustrates the complexity of Korean's inflectional system, which can make it difficult for NLP systems to accurately identify the meaning of words and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Korean also has a highly complex grammar system, including the use of honorifics to indicate social status and respect. For example, the verb \"to give\" in Korean can be conjugated differently depending on the level of formality or politeness required in the situation. This can make it challenging for NLP systems to accurately identify the intended meaning of words and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Korean has a high degree of lexical ambiguity, with many words having multiple meanings depending on the context. For example, the word \"사과\" (sagwa) in Korean can mean either \"apple\" or \"apology,\" depending on the context in which it is used. This ambiguity can further complicate the task of identifying the intended meaning of words and sentences using NLP techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, there are ongoing efforts to develop NLP tools and resources for Korean, including annotated datasets, pre-trained models, and language processing libraries. However, Korean text data is less abundant compared to languages such as English, and there are fewer tools and resources available for NLP in Korean. Additionally, the spacing in Korean text can be arbitrary, especially in informal or colloquial contexts, making it challenging to accurately identify word boundaries and segment text into meaningful units for NLP tasks.\n"

    "### Why NLP is more difficult in Korean?\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is considered more difficult in Korean due to several unique characteristics of the language. While Korean is not considered a low-resource language, it presents challenges for NLP due to the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex grammar: Korean has a highly complex grammar system, including the use of honorifics to indicate social status and respect. This complexity can make it difficult to identify the underlying structure of sentences.\n",
    "- Ambiguity: Korean has a high degree of lexical ambiguity, with many words having multiple meanings depending on the context. This can make it challenging to identify the intended meaning of words and sentences accurately.\n",
    "- Arbitrary spacing: While Korean does use spacing between words, in informal or colloquial contexts, the spacing can be arbitrary and may not strictly follow the linguistic rules or conventions. This can make it difficult to accurately identify word boundaries and segment text into meaningful units for NLP tasks.\n",
    "- Limited training data: Compared to languages such as English, Korean has less training data available for NLP tasks, which can make it challenging to develop accurate and robust models.\n",
    "- Limited resources: There are fewer tools and resources available for NLP in Korean, such as annotated datasets and pre-trained models. This can make it more challenging to develop and deploy NLP systems.\n"

    "## NLP in Low-Resource Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP in low-resource languages can be particularly challenging due to the lack of linguistic resources, including annotated datasets, pre-trained models, and language processing libraries. Low-resource languages typically have fewer speakers and are often underrepresented in digital text, making it difficult to collect sufficient data to train NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lack of data can lead to poor performance when using standard NLP techniques that rely on large amounts of annotated training data. For example, traditional NLP techniques such as rule-based systems, statistical machine translation, and language models may not be effective in low-resource languages due to the lack of data available to train these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, researchers are exploring new approaches to NLP in low-resource languages, such as transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and data augmentation. Transfer learning, in particular, has shown promising results in low-resource settings, where models pre-trained on high-resource languages can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets in low-resource languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to technical challenges, NLP in low-resource languages also raises ethical considerations. For example, NLP systems trained on small, unrepresentative datasets may reinforce biases and stereotypes present in the data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that NLP systems are developed and evaluated with a critical lens, taking into account the social and cultural contexts in which they will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, NLP in low-resource languages is an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to develop tools, resources, and techniques to overcome the challenges posed by the lack of linguistic resources. By leveraging new approaches and ensuring that NLP systems are developed ethically and responsibly, we can help promote linguistic diversity and empower communities who speak low-resource languages.\n"
