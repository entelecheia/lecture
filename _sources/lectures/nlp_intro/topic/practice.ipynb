    "\n",
    "**Term-document matrix**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by creating a term-document matrix, which represents the frequency of terms in each document. The goal is to decompose this matrix into the product of one tall, thin matrix and one wide, short matrix (possibly with a diagonal matrix in between).\n",
    "\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind matrix factorization is to find an optimal way of representing the original term-document matrix using lower-dimensional matrices that capture the latent topic structure in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a dataset of newsgroup documents belonging to several different categories and find topics (groups of words) for them. Knowing the actual categories helps us evaluate whether the discovered topics make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try this with two different matrix factorizations: **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data source**: The dataset used in this example is the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which contains 18,000 newsgroup posts across 20 topics. Newsgroups were popular discussion groups on Usenet in the 80s and 90s before the web took off. We will focus on four categories for this example: \"alt.atheism\", \"talk.religion.misc\", \"comp.graphics\", and \"sci.space\". To remove noise from the data, we will exclude headers, footers, and quotes from the posts.\n"

    "**Stopwords**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopwords are extremely common words that appear to have little value in helping to identify or match documents based on user needs. In text processing and information retrieval, these words are often excluded from the analysis to reduce noise and improve efficiency. Examples of stopwords include \"a\", \"an\", \"the\", \"and\", and \"in\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the trend in information retrieval systems has shifted from using large stop lists (200-300 terms) to very small stop lists (7-12 terms), and eventually to not using stop lists at all. Web search engines typically do not use stop lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stemming and Lemmatization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming and lemmatization are text preprocessing techniques that aim to generate the root form of words. This is particularly useful in information retrieval, as it helps group similar words together and improves search accuracy. Consider the following words:\n",
    "\n",
    "- organize, organizes, and organizing\n",
    "- democracy, democratic, and democratization\n",
    "\n",
    "Both stemming and lemmatization aim to reduce these words to their base forms, making it easier to identify their similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization uses linguistic rules and knowledge about a language to generate the root form of words. The resulting tokens are actual words that carry meaning in the language. In contrast, stemming is a simpler and more heuristic-based approach that truncates words by chopping off their ends. The resulting tokens may not always be real words. As a result, stemming is faster than lemmatization but may not be as accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, stopwords, stemming, and lemmatization are essential techniques in text processing and information retrieval. They help reduce noise, improve efficiency, and enhance the overall effectiveness of search and topic modeling tasks by simplifying the input text and generating meaningful word representations.\n",
