For those two patterns, only a few neurons are required because the patterns are so simple, and there is little variation in the words that receive attention. In contrast, the next-word attention pattern needs to track which of the 512 words receives attention from a given position, i.e., which is the next word. To do so it needs to generate queries and keys such that each query vector matches with a unique key vector from the 512 possibilities.
