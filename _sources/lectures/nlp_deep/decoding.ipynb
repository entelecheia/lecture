    "# Decoding and Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in open-ended language generation due to the development of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2, XLNet, OpenAI-GPT, CTRL, TransfoXL, XLM, BART, T5, GPT-3, and BLOOM. These models have shown promising results in various generation tasks such as open-ended dialogue, summarization, and story generation. Improved decoding methods have played a significant role in the success of these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-regressive language generation assumes that the text being generated can be broken down into a sequence of subparts. Each part depends on the previous parts, allowing an auto-regressive decoder to generate text one token at a time based on its predecessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of generating a word sequence $w_{1:ùëá}$ given an initial context word sequence $W_0$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(w_{1:T} | W_0 ) = \\prod_{t=1}^T P(w_{t} | w_{1: t-1}, W_0) \\text{ ,with }  w_{1: 0} = \\emptyset, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $W_0$ is the initial context word sequence. The length ùëá of the word sequence is determined on-the-fly, which means it is decided as the sequence is generated. The sequence generation typically stops when an End-Of-Sequence (EOS) token is generated from the probability distribution $ùëÉ(w_t|w_{1:ùë°‚àí1},W_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This auto-regressive approach allows LLMs to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on the initial context ùëä0. Different decoding strategies, such as greedy search, beam search, and sampling methods like top-k sampling, have been used to improve the generation quality and diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a language model generating a story based on the context \"Once upon a time, in a small village\":\n",
    "1. Greedy search would select the word with the highest probability at each step, potentially leading to repetitive and less diverse text.\n",
    "2. Beam search would maintain a fixed number of partial sequences (the beam width) and extend them, selecting the most probable overall sequence. This can improve diversity but may still suffer from repetitiveness.\n",
    "3. Top-k sampling would sample the next word from the top-k most probable words, increasing diversity in the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "These strategies help LLMs generate meaningful and diverse text for various language generation tasks.\n"

The algorithm starts by selecting the top k words with the highest probabilities, where k is the beam size. It then extends each of these words with the top k words, given the context.
