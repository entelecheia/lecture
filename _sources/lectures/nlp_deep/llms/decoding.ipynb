    "# Decoding and Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in open-ended language generation due to the development of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2, XLNet, OpenAI-GPT, CTRL, TransfoXL, XLM, BART, T5, GPT-3, and BLOOM. These models have shown promising results in various generation tasks such as open-ended dialogue, summarization, and story generation. Improved decoding methods have played a significant role in the success of these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-regressive language generation assumes that the text being generated can be broken down into a sequence of subparts. Each part depends on the previous parts, allowing an auto-regressive decoder to generate text one token at a time based on its predecessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of generating a word sequence $w_{1:ùëá}$ given an initial context word sequence $W_0$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(w*{1:T} | W_0 ) = \\prod*{t=1}^T P(w*{t} | w*{1: t-1}, W*0) \\text{ ,with } w*{1: 0} = \\emptyset, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $W_0$ is the initial context word sequence. The length ùëá of the word sequence is determined on-the-fly, which means it is decided as the sequence is generated. The sequence generation typically stops when an End-Of-Sequence (EOS) token is generated from the probability distribution $ùëÉ(w_t|w_{1:t‚àí1},W_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This auto-regressive approach allows LLMs to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on the initial context ùëä0. Different decoding strategies, such as greedy search, beam search, and sampling methods like top-k sampling, have been used to improve the generation quality and diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a language model generating a story based on the context \"Once upon a time, in a small village\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Greedy search would select the word with the highest probability at each step, potentially leading to repetitive and less diverse text.\n",
    "2. Beam search would maintain a fixed number of partial sequences (the beam width) and extend them, selecting the most probable overall sequence. This can improve diversity but may still suffer from repetitiveness.\n",
    "3. Top-k sampling would sample the next word from the top-k most probable words, increasing diversity in the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "These strategies help LLMs generate meaningful and diverse text for various language generation tasks.\n"

    "The main idea behind beam search is to explore multiple word options at each step, rather than choosing only the word with the highest probability, as in greedy search. The algorithm starts by selecting the top k words with the highest probabilities, where k is the beam size. It then extends each of these words with the top k words, given the context.

In other words, as humans, we appreciate generated text that is not too predictable or boring. According to a study by [Ari Holtzman et al.

    "Various decoding or search strategies are used in open-ended language generation tasks. Here's an overview of the most common strategies and their characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Greedy Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - At each time step, Greedy Search selects the word with the highest predicted probability to follow the previous word.\n",
    "  - One of the main issues with Greedy Search is that it may miss high-probability words at a certain time step if they are preceded by a low-probability word in the previous step.\n",
    "  - This method often generates repetitive and predictable text, which may not resemble natural human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Beam Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Beam Search tracks the n-th (num_beams) most likely word sequences and ultimately outputs the most likely sequence.\n",
    "  - While this method may seem promising, it struggles when the output length can be highly variable, as is the case with open-ended text generation.\n",
    "  - Like Greedy Search, Beam Search can also produce repetitive and uninteresting text that doesn't align with the way humans perform the same task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sampling With Top-k + Top-p:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This strategy combines three methods to address the issues faced by Greedy and Beam Search.\n",
    "  - Sampling involves choosing the next word randomly based on its conditional probability distribution.\n",
    "  - In Top-k sampling, the model selects the k most likely words and redistributes the probability mass among them before choosing the next word.\n",
    "  - Top-p sampling adds an additional constraint to Top-k by choosing words from the smallest set whose cumulative probability exceeds p.\n",
    "  - While these methods produce more fluent and human-like text, they may still generate repetitive word sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research indicates that the flaws of Greedy and Beam Search, mainly generating repetitive word sequences, are caused by the model itself rather than the decoding method. Top-k and Top-p sampling also suffer from generating repetitive word sequences, but they often provide better results in open-ended language generation tasks compared to Greedy and Beam Search.\n",
