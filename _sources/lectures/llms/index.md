# Large Language Models

## Course Description

This advanced course imparts a comprehensive understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on their architecture, application paradigms, and ethical implications. Structured over 15 weeks, the course is tailored for students with a background in machine learning and natural language processing. It features hands-on training, in-depth analysis of scholarly papers, a midterm examination, and a final project centering on the development of a practical LLM application.

## Learning Goals

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the architectural intricacies of leading LLMs like BERT, T5, and GPT-3.
2. Utilize specialized techniques such as few-shot learning, prompt engineering, and in-context learning in LLMs.
3. Investigate and address ethical concerns including bias and data privacy.
4. Implement a real-world LLM application as part of the final project.
5. Critically evaluate peer projects through a formal review process.

## Grading

- Participation: **10%**
- Midterm Exam: **25%**
- Peer Reviews of Final Project: **5%**
- Final Project: **60%**

## Final Project

The final project mandates students to create a real-world application using a large language model. The project involves data pre-processing, model training/fine-tuning, evaluation, and documentation. Students will also participate in peer reviews to critically evaluate the projects of their peers. The deliverables include a functional LLM application and a research paper.
